## Algo Development

To test your algo locally, you should use the test_algo_[OS] scripts in the scripts folder.

For documentation of the game-config or the json format the engine uses to communicate the current game state, see json-docs.html

For advanced users you can install java and run the game engine locally. Java 10 or above is required: [Java Development Kit 10 or above](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk10-downloads-4416644.html).

To run your algo locally or on our servers, or to enroll your algo in a competition, please see the [documentation 
for the Terminal command line interface in the scripts directory](https://github.com/correlation-one/AIGamesStarterKit/tree/master/scripts)
